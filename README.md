# Url2png::Plus

Generates URL2PNG urls for Ruby projects and integrations with popular web frameworks, like Rails, Sinatra, etc.

## Why `url2png-plus` and not `url2png`?

The `url2png` gem is way more complicated than it needs to be:

1. It tries to be compatible with a bunch of different versions of the url2png HTTP APIs. The client shouldn't worry about this, at least I can't rationalize it.

2. Its insecure out of the box by using the `http` protocol. Configuring the protocol is difficult because the base URL is a "magic string" inside the gem.

3. The project has roughly 1,000 LOC. This project has 40 LOC. That doesn't mean much, but it is less stuff that can break.

This gem only attempts to integrate with the most recent version of URL2PNG, which is v6 at the time of this writing. If URL2PNG upgrades their APIs, this client will be updated to use the new API without any attempt to remain compatible with the old APIs. That burden will be put on using an older version of the gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'url2png-plus'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install url2png-plus

## Usage

```ruby
url2png = Url2png::Plus::Client.new(api_key: "APIKEY", secret: "SECRET")
# The `URL2PNG_API_KEY` and `URL2PNG_SECRET` environment variables are used as a default.
# for web applications you'd set those and initialize via `Url2png::Plus::Client.new`.
url2png.url "https://www.example.com/rabit.png", viewport: "100x100", fullpage: true
```

That's it. Read URL2PNG docs at https://www.url2png.com/docs to know what parameters you can use.

If you'd like to use in Rails or other web applications, include the helper wherever you need it:

```ruby
class ApplicationController
  include Url2png::Plus::Helper

  # Example implementation in a controller
  def redirect_to_image
    redirect_to url2png_url(request.url, viewport: "1024x768")
  end
end
```

## Configuration

If you need to configure in Rails, create `./config/initializers/url2png.rb` and:

```ruby
Url2png::Plus.config do |c|
  c.api_key = "APIKEY"
  c.secret = "SECRET"
  # Why would you change this to `http`? Defaults to `https`
  c.scheme = "http"
end
```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
